## Hi, I'm Selaelo👋

I'm a passionate self-taught frontend developer with a unique background in accounting 📊. I'm based in Gauteng, South Africa 🇿🇦. I started my coding journey in 2023 and have been hooked ever since 💻. To accelerate my learning, I completed a frontend bootcamp with SheCodes and a backend bootcamp with ALX Africa. Without any formal training prior to these bootcamps, I've taught myself to build fast, responsive, and visually appealing web applications through dedication and hard work 💼. When I'm not coding, you can find me cooking up a storm in the kitchen  or trading in the markets 📈. I love the thrill of learning new technologies and solving complex problems, and I'm always looking for the next challenge 🔍.

## My Expertice 👩🏼‍💻

Within the wide breadth of the software industry, I chose to focus on web development as a starting point because of its ubiquity and power. I fell in love with AI and building things with it - its potential to transform industries and revolutionize the way we live and work is truly exciting!
